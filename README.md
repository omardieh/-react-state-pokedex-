# Steps : 
#
#
#### Pokecard.js
- Import useState() from React
- Initialize a state variables that holds the count value with default value of 1.
- create a function that handles increment, it will set the count to (count + 1)
- create a function that handles decrement, it will set the count to (count - 1)
- BONUS : control the increment process with the condition that count should not be greater than 10.
- BONUS : if count is equal to 0, the card should be hidden.

### Finally :
- Add and commit to a new branch and push your solution to gitHub.
- share your Repo link with the instructor/s.
